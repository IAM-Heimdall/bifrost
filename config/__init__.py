# config/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'config' directory a Python package.
# It can also be a place to do initial configuration loading if desired,
# though typically settings are just imported from settings.py.

# from .settings import * # If you want to import all settings here for some reason

# For now, it can remain empty or just document its purpose.
